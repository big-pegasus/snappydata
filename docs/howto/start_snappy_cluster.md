# How to Start a SnappyData Cluster
## Start SnappyData Cluster on a single machine

If you have [downloaded and extracted](../install.md) the SnappyData product distribution, navigate to the SnappyData product root directory.

**Start the Cluster**: Run the `sbin/snappy-start-all.sh` script to start the SnappyData cluster on your single machine using default settings. This starts a lead node, a locator, and a data server.

```no-highlight
$ sbin/snappy-start-all.sh
```

It may take 30 seconds or more to bootstrap the entire cluster on your local machine.

**Sample Output**: The sample output for `snappy-start-all.sh` is displayed as:

## Start SnappyData Cluster on Multiple Hosts

To start the cluster on multiple hosts:

1. The easiest way to run SnappyData on multiple nodes is to use a shared file system such as NFS on all the nodes.</br> You can also extract the product distribution on each node of the cluster. If all nodes have NFS access, install SnappyData on any one of the nodes.

2. Create the configuration files using the templates provided in the **conf** folder. Copy the existing template files (**servers.template**, **locators.template** and **leads.template**) and rename them to **servers**, **locators**, **leads**.
</br> Edit the files to include the hostnames on which to start the server, locator, and lead. Refer to the [configuration](../configuring_cluster/configuring_cluster.md) section for more information on properties.

3. Start the cluster using `sbin/snappy-start-all.sh`. SnappyData starts the cluster using SSH.

!!! Note: 
	It is recommended that you set up passwordless SSH on all hosts in the cluster. Refer to the documentation for more details on [installation](../install/install_on_premise.md) and [cluster configuration](../configuring_cluster/configuring_cluster.md).
