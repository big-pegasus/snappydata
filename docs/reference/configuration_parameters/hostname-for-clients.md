# hostname-for-clients
Hostname given to clients that ask the locator for the location of a JMX Manager. By default the IP address of the JMX Manager is used. However, for clients on a different network, you can configure a different hostname to be given to clients. Ignored if jmx-manager is false or if jmx-manager-port is zero.
