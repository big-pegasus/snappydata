# SnappyData Pulse

SnappyData Pulse is a monitoring system that gives you a high-level overview of the status and performance of the cluster. It provides a simple widget based view, which helps you easily navigate and monitor your cluster.</br>

To access the SnappyData Pulse, start your cluster and open http:`<leadhost>`:5050/dashboard/ in your web browser. </br>
`<leadhost>` is the hostname or IP of the lead node in your cluster.

The top-right side of the page displays the last updated date and time for the member.

<a id="memberstats"></a>

	*  **Load New**: Loads latest log entries from the log file (if generated) after logs were last loaded/updated.    </br> 
	*  **Load More**: Loads older log entries from log files, if available.

<a id="sql"></a>
## SQL Page
![](../Images/query_analysis_sql.png)

* **Colocated**: When colocated tables are joined on the partitioning columns, the join happens locally on the node where data is present, without the need of shuffling the data. This improves the performance of the query significantly instead of broadcasting the data across all the data partitions.

* **Whole-Stage Code Generation**: A whole stage code generation node compiles a sub-tree of plans that support code generation together into a single Java function, which helps improve execution performance.

* **Per node execution timing**: Displays the time required for the execution of each node. If there are too many rows that are not getting filtered or exchanged.

* **Pool Name**: Default/Low Latency. Applications can explicitly configure the use of this pool using a SQL command `set snappydata.scheduler.pool=lowlatency`. 

* **Query Node Details**: Move the mouse over a component to view its details.

* **Filter**: Displays the number of rows that are filtered for each node. 

* **Joins**: If HashJoin puts pressure on memory, you can change the HashJoin size to use SortMergeJoin to avoid on-heap memory pressure.

<a id="jobs"></a>
## Jobs Page
![](../Images/query_analysis_job.png)

* **Status**: Displays the status of the job. 

* **Stages**: Click on the stage to view its details. The table displays the time taken for completion of each stage. 

!!! Tip:
	You can cancel a long running job, using the **Kill** option. </br>![kill](../Images/kill_job.png)

<a id="stages"></a>
## Stages Page
![](../Images/query_analysis_stage.png)

* On this page, you can view the total time required for all the tasks in a job to complete.

* You can view if any tasks have taken a long time to complete. This may occur in case of uneven data distribution. 

* Scheduler Delay indicates the waiting period for the task. Delays can  be caused if there are too many concurrent jobs.

* Shuffle reads and writes: Shuffles are written to disk and take a lot of time to write and read. This can be avoided by using colocated and replicated tables. You can use high-performance SSD drives for temporary storage (spark.local.dir) to improve shuffle time.  

* Number of parallel tasks: Due to concurrency, multiple queries may take cores and a particular query may take longer. To fix this, you can create a new scheduler and [assign appropriate cores to it](../best_practices/setup_cluster.md).

* GC time: Occasionally, on-heap object creation can slow down a query because of garbage collection. In these cases, it is recommended that you increase the on-heap memory (especially when you have row tables).
