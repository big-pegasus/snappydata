   * Callback to spark Utils to fetch file
   * Download a file or directory to target directory. Supports fetching the file in a variety of
   * ways, including HTTP, Hadoop-compatible filesystems, and files on a standard filesystem, based
   * on the URL parameter. Fetching directories is only supported from Hadoop-compatible
   * filesystems.
   *
   * If `useCache` is true, first attempts to fetch the file to a local cache that's shared
   * across executors running the same application. `useCache` is used mainly for
   * the executors, and not in local mode.
   *
   * Throws SparkException if the target file already exists and has different contents than
   * the requested file.
