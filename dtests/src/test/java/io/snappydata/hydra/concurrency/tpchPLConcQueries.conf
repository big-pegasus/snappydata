This test starts the snappy cluster.
Test then spawns the specified number of jdbc clients to run the point lookup and analytical
queries concurrently with data size of 10 GB of TPCH data.
It then verifies how many concurrent point lookup queries can be executed in the 15 minutes time span
with 60 threads executing these queries concurrently through JDBC connection.";
